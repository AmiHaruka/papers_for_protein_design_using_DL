# List of papers about Proteins Design using Deep Learning
## Background
Inspired by Kevin Kaichuang Yang's [Machine-learning-for-proteins](https://github.com/yangkky/Machine-learning-for-proteins).  
I'm a newcomer to protein design focused in DL, in terms of the fast hanging of this field, the dynamic repository will be a record of papers for these newcomers like me.  
**There is a hallucination in protein design, that we believe DL could be an good answer to solve the hot potato.**
