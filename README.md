# List of papers about Proteins Design using Deep Learning

## About this repository

Inspired by Kevin Kaichuang Yang's [Machine-learning-for-proteins](https://github.com/yangkky/Machine-learning-for-proteins). In terms of the fast changing of protein design in DL, the dynamic repository will be a record of papers for these newcomers to like me.  

## Background

**There is a hallucination in protein design, that we believe DL could be an good answer to solve the hot potato.**

## Menu

* function to scaffold
* scaffold to sequence
* function to sequence
